If you want to create your own bot in the same way you have to create a new dedicated account and you have to registred it on https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to get your own oauth token
Then you have to go on https://dev.twitch.tv/console and log in with your account bot and add a new application put in the oauth fields "https://localhost/<youroauthtoken>", call it how you want and save for you the oauth token and the clientID code.
